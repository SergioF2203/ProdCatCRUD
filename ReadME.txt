how its work:
first: you need to build the app. It neessary for update links

second: you need to launch the app. In the first start will be create a DB with some records. (in DB will be user already, with login: Admin and pass: administrator)

third: you need to comment DbInintializer in Global.asax.
that's all.

now you can add products to DB, Category etc. you can edit and remove, but it all possible only login Admin.
you can to register a new user and get some options like as watch products and categories.

Have a nice day!! )))
